# Hand-crafted and Deep Learning-based CMR Radiomics for Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Diseases

Repository of documents for the final Master's thesis of the Master's in Fundamentals in Data Science at the University of Barcelona. This thesis was supervised by Polyxeni 
Gkontra and Karim Lekadir from the Artitificial Intelligence Labortary in Medicine at University of Barcelona. 

This repository corresponds to Jupyter Notebooks and Python files to develop pipeline for the extraction of Hand Crafted Radiomics and Deep Learning-based radiomics
and ultimately, the fusion of these both types of features.  We also provide the code for the extraction of the radiomics from the <em> PyRadiomics</em> library and pre-processing
of the images.

#### Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are subject of interest among research and clinicians due its high mortality rate. Cardiac Magnetic resonance (CMR) is the reference for
clinicians to analyze the heart tissues by visual assessment and crude quantitative
measures of the structures to dictate a diagnosis of the patientâ€™s status. Radiomics
is a novel image analysis technique extract large number of quantitative features
from CMR that provide insightful information of the heart structures to support
clinicians in the diagnosis and prognosis of these diseases. Previous studies have
demonstrated the capacity of these features to obtain higher diagnosis accuracy than
conventional methods. In this study, we cover in depth Radiomics technique and explore
two types of radiomics: Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR) and Deep Learningbased
Radiomics (DLR). HCR comprehend a wide range of quantification features
of the shape, intensity, and texture of the area of interest. DLR are features extracted
based in the training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We address the
methodology for the extraction of the features for both methods and analyze the
performance in the CVDs classification task with Machine Learning (ML) algorithm.
We also develop a pipeline for the fusion of these features with the aim of collecting
complementary information of the heart structures from both mentioned methods
with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. We apply this methodology with two
benchmark medical datasets: ACDC Challenge dataset and UK Bio Bank with the
availability of both CMR and the segmentation of the heart structures: Myocardium
(MYO), Right Ventricle (RV) and Left Ventricle (LV). We perform an analysis of the
results, discuss challenges and elaborate on future work.
